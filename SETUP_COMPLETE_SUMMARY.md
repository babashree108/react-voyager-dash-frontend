## 🎯 Your Three-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Test Locally (10 minutes) ⭐

```bash
# In your project directory
./deploy.sh
# Choose: 1 (Fresh deployment)

# Wait 5-10 minutes ☕

# Test it works
./health-check.sh
open http://localhost
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost
- ✅ Backend: http://localhost:8080
- ✅ All services healthy

### Step 2: Deploy to VPS (20 minutes)

```bash
# SSH to your Hostinger VPS
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP

# Run automated setup
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/main/vps-initial-setup.sh -o setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Enter your GitHub repo URL when prompted
# Wait 10-15 minutes

# IMPORTANT: Save the credentials it shows at the end!
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Application live at: http://YOUR_VPS_IP
- ✅ All services running
- ✅ Firewall configured
- ✅ Ready for CI/CD

### Step 3: Setup CI/CD (15 minutes)

**A. Generate SSH Key (on your local machine):**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions" -f ~/.ssh/nxtclass_deploy
# Press Enter (no passphrase)
```

**B. Add to VPS:**
```bash
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Paste: content of ~/.ssh/nxtclass_deploy.pub
# Save and exit
```

**C. Add GitHub Secrets:**

Go to: **GitHub → Your Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

Add 3 secrets:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `VPS_HOST` | Your VPS IP (e.g., 123.45.67.89) |
| `VPS_USERNAME` | `root` |
| `VPS_SSH_KEY` | Entire content of `~/.ssh/nxtclass_deploy` |

**D. Test It:**
```bash
# Make a change
echo "# CI/CD Test" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: CI/CD deployment"
git push origin main

# Watch magic happen!
# Go to: GitHub → Actions
# Should auto-deploy in 3-5 minutes
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ GitHub Actions runs automatically
- ✅ Deploys to VPS
- ✅ Application updates at http://YOUR_VPS_IP
- ✅ Takes 3-5 minutes

## 🔥 Pro Tips

### IP-Based Access (No Domain Required)

Your setup is configured to work with just your VPS IP address:

```env
# .env on VPS is configured with:
VITE_API_URL=http://YOUR_VPS_IP/api
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://YOUR_VPS_IP
```

No domain needed for testing! 🎉

### Automatic Updates

Every time you push to main:
- ✅ Code deploys automatically
- ✅ Reviewers always see latest version
- ✅ Zero downtime deployments
- ✅ Takes 3-5 minutes

### Monitoring

```bash
# Watch deployments
GitHub → Actions → Latest workflow

# Check application
curl http://YOUR_VPS_IP/health

# View VPS logs
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP
cd /opt/nxtclass
docker-compose logs -f
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Can't access http://localhost

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if port 80 is in use
sudo lsof -i :80

# Change port in docker-compose.yml if needed
ports: ["8081:80"]
# Then access: http://localhost:8081
```

### Issue: VPS deployment fails

**Solution:**
```bash
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP
cd /opt/nxtclass
docker-compose logs

# Common fixes:
docker-compose restart
# or
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

### Issue: CI/CD SSH fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test SSH key manually
ssh -i ~/.ssh/nxtclass_deploy root@YOUR_VPS_IP

# Verify GitHub secret has ENTIRE private key
cat ~/.ssh/nxtclass_deploy
# Copy including -----BEGIN and -----END lines
```

### Issue: Frontend shows API errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Rebuild frontend with correct API URL
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP
cd /opt/nxtclass
docker-compose build frontend --no-cache
docker-compose up -d frontend
```
