âœ… FIXED - Node.js Version Issue

PROBLEM:
--------
Ubuntu 22.04 comes with Node.js v12.22.9
Your frontend requires Node.js >= 18

Error was:
  npm WARN EBADENGINE current: { node: 'v12.22.9' }
  vite requires: { node: '^18.0.0 || >=20.0.0' }

SOLUTION:
---------
Updated Dockerfile.local to install Node.js 20.x from NodeSource

Changes:
1. Removed old nodejs/npm from apt-get
2. Added Node.js 20.x installation from official source
3. Now installs Node 20 which supports Vite

NOW TRY AGAIN:
--------------
./test-local.sh

This will rebuild with Node.js 20 and work properly!
