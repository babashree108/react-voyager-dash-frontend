SUPERVISOR NOT RUNNING - CONTAINER IS BROKEN

Run these commands to see what's wrong:

# Check what processes are running inside container
docker exec nxtclass-local ps aux

# Check if start script ran
docker exec nxtclass-local ls -la /start.sh

# Try to see what's in the logs
docker logs nxtclass-local

# Check if supervisor config exists
docker exec nxtclass-local ls -la /etc/supervisor/conf.d/

QUICK FIX - STOP AND USE PROPER SETUP:

docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml down
docker-compose up -d

This uses the working 3-container setup instead!
