## 🔐 Security Features

- **Forced Fullscreen** - Students cannot exit during class
- **Window Monitoring** - Detects tab switches and window blur
- **Violation Recording** - All monitoring events logged
- **Real-Time Alerts** - Teacher notified immediately
- **Blocked Actions** - Prevents context menu, certain key combos

## 📊 Student Monitoring

The system tracks:
- ✅ Fullscreen status
- ✅ Window focus state
- ✅ Tab switches
- ✅ Violations with timestamps
- ✅ Camera/microphone status
- ✅ Hand raise events

## 🎨 Digital Notebook Features

- **Drawing Tools:** Pen, Highlighter, Eraser
- **Color Picker:** 8 colors
- **Pen Width:** 3 sizes (2px, 4px, 8px)
- **Multi-Page:** Unlimited pages
- **Undo:** Undo last action
- **Clear:** Clear entire page
- **Export:** Save as PNG
- **Live Sync:** Real-time sharing with teacher

## 🔄 Real-Time Events

| Event | Description | Participants |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `participant-joined` | Student/teacher joins | All |
| `participant-left` | Student/teacher leaves | All |
| `hand-raise` | Student raises hand | All |
| `broadcast-control` | Teacher broadcasts student | All |
| `mute-all-students` | Teacher mutes everyone | Students |
| `monitoring-alert` | Student monitoring update | Teacher |
| `notebook-update` | Notebook page updated | Teacher |
| `webrtc-signal` | WebRTC negotiation | Peer-to-peer |

## 🧪 Testing

### Test as Teacher
1. Login as teacher
2. Join virtual classroom
3. View participant list
4. Test mute all
5. Broadcast a student
6. View student notebooks

### Test as Student
1. Login as student
2. Join classroom (forced fullscreen)
3. See teacher video only
4. Raise hand
5. Open digital notebook
6. Draw and see live sync

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

For production with 100+ concurrent users:
- Use Redis for session management
- Implement dedicated media server (Janus/Kurento)
- Add load balancing
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement TURN server for NAT traversal

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Fullscreen API** - Not supported on all mobile browsers
2. **WebRTC** - Requires good internet connection
3. **Simple Broker** - Current implementation uses in-memory broker
4. **No Authentication** - Needs to be added for production

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add Spring Security + JWT authentication
- [ ] Implement session recording
- [ ] Add chat functionality
- [ ] Create breakout rooms
- [ ] Screen sharing support
- [ ] AI-based attention detection
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Attendance tracking
- [ ] Quiz integration
