## üß™ Step 1: Local Testing First

**Goal:** Verify everything works locally before deploying to VPS

### Prerequisites Check

```bash
# Check Docker
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# If not installed:
# - Windows/Mac: Download Docker Desktop
# - Linux: curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

### Start Local Testing

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /path/to/nxtclass

# 2. Verify .env exists
ls -la .env
# Should already exist with localhost configuration

# 3. Start everything
./deploy.sh
# Choose: 1 (Fresh deployment)

# 4. Wait 5-10 minutes for first build
# Coffee break! ‚òï

# 5. Check health
./health-check.sh
```

### Verify Everything Works

```bash
# Test frontend
curl http://localhost/health
# Expected: healthy

# Test backend
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
# Expected: {"status":"UP"}

# Test API
curl http://localhost/api/student-details/list
# Expected: [] or JSON array

# Open browser
open http://localhost
```

### Local Testing Checklist

- [ ] Frontend loads at http://localhost
- [ ] No console errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
- [ ] Can navigate to login page
- [ ] Backend API responds
- [ ] Database connection works
- [ ] All services show "Up" in `docker-compose ps`

**‚úÖ If all checks pass, proceed to Step 2!**

### Stop Local Testing

```bash
# Stop services (keeps data)
docker-compose down

# Or full cleanup
docker-compose down -v
```

## üöÄ Step 2: VPS Initial Setup

**Goal:** Setup your Hostinger VPS with automated script

### Get Your VPS IP

1. Login to Hostinger control panel
2. Find your VPS IP address
3. Note it down: `123.45.67.89` (example)

### SSH to Your VPS

```bash
# Connect to VPS
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP
# Enter your VPS password

# You should see something like:
# Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
# root@vps-xxxxx:~#
```

### Run Automated Setup Script

**Option A: Run from GitHub (Recommended)**

```bash
# Download and run setup script
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOURUSERNAME/YOURREPO/main/vps-initial-setup.sh -o setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Follow the prompts:
# 1. Enter your GitHub repository URL
#    Example: https://github.com/username/nxtclass.git
# 2. Wait 10-15 minutes for installation
# 3. Note down the credentials shown at the end
```

**Option B: Manual Setup (If script fails)**

```bash
# 1. Update system
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# 2. Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh

# 3. Install Docker Compose
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# 4. Install Git
apt install git -y

# 5. Clone repository
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/YOURREPO.git nxtclass
cd nxtclass

# 6. Get your VPS IP
VPS_IP=$(curl -s ifconfig.me)
echo "Your VPS IP: $VPS_IP"

# 7. Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
nano .env

# Update these values in .env:
VITE_API_URL=http://YOUR_VPS_IP/api
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://YOUR_VPS_IP
# Change all passwords to strong values!

# 8. Configure firewall
apt install ufw -y
ufw allow 22/tcp
ufw allow 80/tcp
ufw allow 443/tcp
ufw --force enable

# 9. Deploy
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d

# 10. Check status
docker-compose ps
```

### Verify VPS Deployment

```bash
# On VPS, check services
cd /opt/nxtclass
./health-check.sh

# From your local machine
curl http://YOUR_VPS_IP/health
# Expected: healthy

# Open in browser
http://YOUR_VPS_IP
```

### VPS Setup Checklist

**‚úÖ VPS is ready! Proceed to Step 3 for CI/CD.**

---

## üîÑ Step 3: CI/CD Configuration

**Goal:** Setup automatic deployment on git push to main

### Part A: Setup SSH Keys for GitHub Actions

**On your LOCAL machine:**

```bash
# 1. Generate SSH key pair
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions-deploy" -f ~/.ssh/nxtclass_deploy
# Press Enter for no passphrase (required for automation)

# 2. View public key
cat ~/.ssh/nxtclass_deploy.pub
# Copy this entire output

# 3. View private key
cat ~/.ssh/nxtclass_deploy
# Copy this entire output (including BEGIN and END lines)
```

**On your VPS:**

```bash
# SSH to VPS
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP

# Add public key to authorized_keys
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Paste the PUBLIC key content
# Save: Ctrl+X, Y, Enter

# Set permissions
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**Test SSH key authentication:**

```bash
# From your local machine
ssh -i ~/.ssh/nxtclass_deploy root@YOUR_VPS_IP
# Should connect WITHOUT asking for password
exit
```

### Part B: Add GitHub Secrets

Go to GitHub:

**Your Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret**

Add these 3 secrets:

#### Secret 1: VPS_HOST
- **Name:** `VPS_HOST`
- **Value:** Your VPS IP (e.g., `123.45.67.89`)

#### Secret 2: VPS_USERNAME  
- **Name:** `VPS_USERNAME`
- **Value:** `root`

#### Secret 3: VPS_SSH_KEY
- **Name:** `VPS_SSH_KEY`
- **Value:** Paste ENTIRE content of `~/.ssh/nxtclass_deploy` (private key)
  ```
  -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
  b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAACmFlczI1Ni1jdHIAAAAGYmNyeXB0AAAA...
  ... entire key content ...
  -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
  ```

#### Optional Secret: VPS_PORT
- **Name:** `VPS_PORT`
- **Value:** `22` (default SSH port)

### Part C: Verify Workflow Files Exist

```bash
# Check if workflow files exist
ls -la .github/workflows/

# Should show:
# deploy.yml - Deploys on push to main
# test.yml   - Tests on PRs and feature branches
```

### CI/CD Setup Checklist

- [ ] SSH key pair generated
- [ ] Public key added to VPS authorized_keys
- [ ] SSH key authentication tested (works without password)
- [ ] GitHub secret `VPS_HOST` added
- [ ] GitHub secret `VPS_USERNAME` added
- [ ] GitHub secret `VPS_SSH_KEY` added (private key)
- [ ] Workflow files exist in `.github/workflows/`

**‚úÖ CI/CD configured! Proceed to Step 4 for testing.**
